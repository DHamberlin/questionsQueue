# Roadmap

## Future Features

- Slack bot integration
Students should be able to submit questions via Slack.

- Analytics
Instructors should be able to compile statistics about questions asked by topic and cohort.

- Separate admin from instructor roles
Currently, there are only two roles, admin and student.

- Admin Dashboard
Add users, create groups.

- Instructor Dashboard
Gives staff access to analytics.

- Create groups for cohorts
Lists of questions should be tied to a specific cohort.

- Implement permission scoping to backend
The current implementation only hides the edit/delete buttons on the front-end. If a user makes API calls, they can bypass the restrictions.

- Add answers
